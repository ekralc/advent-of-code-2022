# Advent of Code Solutions
This is the repository for my AoC 2022 solutions.

The solutions are mainly in Python. I plan to mix in some Go and C++ as a bonus.

## Usage
All programs have the same interface. They read the puzzle input from `stdin` and output the final answer to `stdout`.

### Examples 
If on macOS, use `pbpaste` to pipe the clipboard contents. 
```bash
pbpaste | python 01/python/part_one.py
```

Read from a local `input` file.
```bash
python 01/python/part_one.py < input
```
