# Advent of Code Solutions

This is the repository for my AoC 2022 solutions.

The solutions are mainly in Python. I plan to mix in some Go and C++ as a bonus.

## Usage
All programs read the full plaintext input from `stdin` and output the final answer to `stdout`.

For example, you can pipe the contents of a file.

```bash
go run day1/go/part_one.go < your_file_name
```

Or, if on macOS, pipe the clipboard contents using `pbpaste`:
```bash
pbpaste | python3 day1/python/part_one.py
```
